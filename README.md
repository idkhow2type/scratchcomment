# Scratch project that displays its comments 
<sup>(i dont have a real name for this project)</sup>

This is the backend code for [this project on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/665383813/) that can display its own comments (a thing you normally can't do)

Like most of my projects, I'm just dumping it here and there will be no documentation or anything of sorts (to be honest it's not really complicated). I might respond to issues and pull requests or whatever but don't expect the response to be fast

Thanks to Sid72020123 for the `scratchconnect` library and some debugging help
